# MaxMeasures
A Rainmeter Skin that adds Time, Date, NowPlaying and other metrics to your desktop, all in a similar font as the company Maxell uses

# Important!
Due to the licensing agreement of the makers of the ElMax font, I am not allowed to include the font in this repository without written permission, as this is the case, it is not currently included.

However, the font is free and available from the makers at https://www.typedifferent.com/font-bd-elmax/
once installed, put the font in the folder "MaxellMeasure/@Resources/Fonts" and everything should work perfectly
