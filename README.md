# MaxMeasures
A Rainmeter Skin that adds Time, Date, NowPlaying and other metrics to your desktop, all in a similar font as the company Maxell uses

# Important!
Due to the licensing agreement provided with the ElMax font, I am not allowed to redistribute the font without written permission (like provide it in this repo), as this is the case, it is not currently included.

However, the font is free and available from the makers at https://www.typedifferent.com/font-bd-elmax/
once installed, put the font in the folder "MaxellMeasure/@Resources/Fonts" and everything should work perfectly

Hopefully this will change in the future
